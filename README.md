### Max's 65c02 Been Eater's computer build

All scripts for each video are posted in their respective folders.

- For monitoring the 6502, I am using Nectivio's [65C02-Tool](https://github.com/Nectivio/65C02-Tool).
  - If the [PR](https://github.com/Nectivio/65C02-Tool/pull/2) isn't merged, use my fork of the monitor, as it adds support for viewing the  `ROR` command that Ben uses in the second video.
- For writing to the 65c02, I am using Nectivio's [65C02-Tool](https://github.com/Nectivio/65C02-Tool) which allows for in-circuit programming.
- For compiling the Assembily code, I am using the same assembler that Ben used: [Vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/).
